4. To set up your download, select English, Shapefile (.shp), and Cartographic Boundary File under the Type dropdown menu. (Note: Cartographic Boundary Files (CBF) follow coastlines and include water bodies whereas Digital Boundary Files (DBF) are defined around major land masses). Make sure to select **Provinces/territories** under the **Administartive boundaries** menu. Once the required parameters are selected, click Continue.

5. Download the zip file from the link provided and save it to your project folder.
6. Geospatial data often comes in a zip file as it is made up of a collection of files. You will need to unzip it to use it in ArcGIS Pro. To unzip it, right click on the zip file and select **Extract all**.
